# CSCI561
Implement a game at which two agents alternate in assigning values to the variables of a constraint satisfaction problem(CSP). Combine arc-consistency and alpha-beta pruning and compute the next best action for player 1  by employing Minimax (with alpha-beta pruning) to take future outcomes of both playersâ€™ turns into account.
